                    <p>Living in NYC or even the suburbs without leaving your own house is now becoming more feasible.</p>

                    <h2>Living Multi-Local is Easier Than Ever:</h2>

                    <h3>1. Purchase Items Online</h3>
                    <p>You can buy food on Whole Foods delivery and avoid the hassle of taking the subway to the store. Not to mention that virtually anything can now be bought online with convenience thanks to Amazon.</p>

                    <h3>2. No Need for a Car</h3>
                    <p>Since you'll do most of your major purchases through the internet, you'll only need to leave the house when you want. If you need to, you can use an Uber.</p>

                    <h3>3. Paying for Just the Nights You Need and Sharing Otherwise</h3>
                    <p>You don't need or want to be close to your office 7 nights a week, so why do it. Rent and pay for a Split Lease for only your in-office days and live anywhere during the rest of the week.</p>

                            <p><strong>The New Reality</strong></p>
                            <p>The luxury of living out of two homes is no longer exclusive to the monied elite. The pandemic has changed the work environment. In this new world, hiring and talent allocation will need to be adjusted.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <h2>The Tech Worker Advantage</h2>
                    <p>For those of us used to using technology effectively, the transition to work from home has been a welcome one. Now, the workplace is shifting to a new environment where the typical 5 day 8 hour in-office work week no longer applies. With this comes a whole new opportunity. For the first time, <strong>young people can live in two homes at an affordable rate.</strong></p>

                    <h3>Tech Jobs Are Flexible</h3>
                    <p>Tech jobs especially are flexible. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has promised that employees only need to spend 3 days in the office. Google expects, "60 percent of its employees to be on a flexible work setup, with 20 percent working from home, and 20 percent physically present in new office locations."</p>

                    <p>Salesforce's CEO says, "<strong>the 9-5 workday is dead</strong>." Many employees will go flex, with some of them going fully remote.</p>

                            <p><strong>What does this mean for you?</strong></p>
                            <p>This means you have the freedom to live outside the city. You now have the freedom to live where you want and while still having a place where you need to be.</p>

                    </div>

                    <h2>Multi-Local: The Trend for 2020-2030</h2>
                    <p>If Nomads was the trend in 2010-2020, <strong>multi-local could be the trend 2020-2030</strong>. At Split Lease, we're building it right now. Now, you can live in two homes without breaking the bank. Keep your house in the suburbs, but fully experience living in the city and being close to the office.</p>

                    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The work environment of today no longer requires employees to be close to the office during the work-week. <strong>Multi-local is the trend for 2020-2030</strong>, where forward thinkers can take advantage of this real-estate trend.</li>
                        <li>Living out of two homes no longer requires a big bank account. Rent a Split Lease for <strong>only your in-office days</strong> and <strong>live anywhere during the rest of the week.</strong></li>
                        <li>Living anywhere has never been easier. From ordering groceries to catching a ride, <strong>today's companies empower people to have what they need to live whenever they need it</strong>.</li>
                    </ul>
