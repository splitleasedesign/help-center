                    <p>Hybrid work is here to stay. According to McKinsey and Company, "nine out of ten organizations will be combining remote and on-site working." So, while you may be spending some more time out of the office, don't expect to stay fully remote. With the return of in-office time also comes the return of your commute.</p>

                            <p><strong>The Hybrid Work Reality</strong></p>
                            <p>Hybrid working employees looking to avoid their commute can turn to repeat rentals to stay in the city during their in-office days. This way, they can avoid the hassle and wasted time of driving back and forth to work. These can be hard to find, but maybe Airbnb can help?</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Let's Try the Airbnb "Solution"</h2>
                    <p>One way that a commuter and prospective renter could solve this problem is by booking an Airbnb. Let's call our commuter Brandon. He's a consultant who lives in Bridgewater, NJ and works in NYC. He is required to be in the office 3 days a week, or Mon-Wed.</p>

                    <h3>The Problem with Airbnb for Recurring Stays</h3>
                    <p>The problem is that services such as Airbnb don't specifically support this type of schedule. Without a continuous stay, Brandon would need to make multiple short term bookings, costing him time and a LOT of money due to additional taxes and fees. These bookings would likely not even be worth accommodating as an Airbnb host.</p>

                    <h3>NYC's Multiple Dwelling Law (MDL)</h3>
                    <p>This is because of NYC laws, specifically the multiple dwelling law commonly known as MDL. Under MDL, hosts cannot rent out an apartment for less than 30 days at a time (in a building with 3 or more rooms) without a host in the same building. This means hosts will have to live onsite if they want to host these short term rentals.</p>

                    <div class="info-box info">
                        <div class="info-box-icon">
                            <i data-feather="alert-circle"></i>
                        </div>
                        <div class="info-box-content">
                            <p><strong>The Workaround Problem</strong></p>
                            <p>A way to avoid this burden of living on site is to rent in chunks of 30 days or longer. The city is concerned that unmanaged short term properties will cause damage to the neighborhoods they're in. They're also concerned that too many short term listings will push out New Yorkers from affording housing.</p>
                            <p>Under this solution, Brandon would be leasing a space month to month paying for 4 nights a week that he isn't even using!</p>

                    </div>

                    <h2>The Airbnb Verdict for Hybrid Workers</h2>
                    <p>So, it is settled. Airbnb is a great solution, assuming you are made of money and have the time to make these bookings each week. To find his tailored hybrid work rental solution, Brandon would either have to:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Rent a full month at a time and overpay</strong> for 4 nights per week he's not using</li>
                        <li><strong>Try to piece together the days as he goes</strong>, wasting a tremendous amount of time and energy</li>
                        <li><strong>Pay excessive fees and taxes</strong> with each short-term booking</li>
                        <li><strong>Risk losing his preferred space</strong> as availability changes week to week</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>I guess it's time to find a new job... unless—</p>

                    <h2>There is a Better Way... Book A Split Lease!</h2>
                    <p>The best solution does not have to be to find a new job. The best solution is a Split Lease!</p>

                            <p><strong>How Split Lease Solves Brandon's Problem</strong></p>
                            <p>On Split Lease, Brandon can find repeat rentals for the nights he needs, so he'll only pay for the times he is there. With one booking, Brandon locks down his second home for when he is in the office and knows he is getting the best price by paying by the night.</p>

                    <h3>Split Lease Advantages for Hybrid Workers</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>One booking covers all your nights</strong> - no need to rebook weekly</li>
                        <li><strong>Pay only for nights used</strong> - not forced to pay for unused days</li>
                        <li><strong>Same space every time</strong> - consistency and familiarity</li>
                        <li><strong>No surprise fees</strong> - transparent pricing from the start</li>
                        <li><strong>Store your belongings</strong> - leave work clothes, toiletries, etc.</li>
                        <li><strong>Try before committing</strong> - trial nights available</li>
                        <li><strong>Legal compliance</strong> - periodic tenancy, not short-term rentals</li>
                    </ul>
