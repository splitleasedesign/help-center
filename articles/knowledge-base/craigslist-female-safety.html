                <div class="article-body">
                    <p>Craigslist is a multi-billion dollar company. Craigslist has been the source of many rentals over the years especially in urban areas. Did you know it was originally Craigslist traffic which helped kickstart Airbnb into prominence?</p>

                    <h2>Why Craigslist Is Still Relevant for Hybrid Housing</h2>
                    <p>Even now, Craigslist is one of the premier places to get hybrid housing. This is because Airbnb is heavily regulated in NYC while Craigslist is not. During the past 2 years, <strong>the number of short term rentals on Airbnb in NYC has fallen by 90%</strong>.</p>

                    <div class="info-box info">
                        <div class="info-box-icon">
                            <i data-feather="alert-triangle"></i>
                        </div>
                        <div class="info-box-content">
                            <p><strong>Safety Warning</strong></p>
                            <p>Craigslist is <strong>by no means considered a safe place</strong>. On Craigslist Killings, a site which tracks murders directly attributable to Craigslist, there has been "as many as <strong>128 murders</strong> since the site started accepting classified ads".</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Safety Concerns</h2>

                    <h3>1. No Review System</h3>
                    <p>Not having reviews is risky, but even then, that wouldn't catch first time offenders. What Craigslist has in privacy, it <strong>lacks in safety</strong>.</p>

                    <h3>2. Masked Communications</h3>
                    <p>Masking communications is a double edged sword. When buying and selling on Craigslist, email addresses are hidden. Though this may protect privacy, this makes both parties less trusting.</p>

                    <h3>3. In-Person Meetings</h3>
                    <p>Meeting in person is less safe for women. There is no way to check the veracity and credentials of the hosts on Craigslist.</p>

                    <h3>4. Scammers Are Prevalent</h3>
                    <p>Some sections of Craigslist are safer than others. For example, apartment / housing or office and commercial is a paid section where most of the credible postings are. However, Craigslist scammers are prevalent.</p>

                    <h3>5. Cash Transactions</h3>
                    <p>Exchanging money in person is risky. Craigslist doesn't have any way to transfer money. Sometimes in an argument, <strong>having an intermediary be involved in a money transfer can help secure safety</strong>. When using Craigslist, consider not using cash to pay for real estate purchases and establishing a pattern of using <strong>an intermediary to help prevent unnecessary risks</strong>.</p>

                    <h3>6. Suspicious Listings</h3>
                    <p>Some Craigslist posts specifically mention that the person living in the unit wants someone female to live with them and not pay rent. These listings detract from Craigslist's total experience and leaves users wondering, how many other dangerous people use this website?</p>
