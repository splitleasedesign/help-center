                            <p><strong>Success Story</strong></p>
                            <p>This is the story of how we helped Brad save 45% off his stay, a savings of <strong>$3,245 compared to Airbnb</strong> (with an Airbnb host!). Brad needed a place to stay for visitation with his daughter in NYC on the weekends. What Brad was looking for was a <strong>repeat rental</strong>.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Brad's Challenge</h2>
                    <p>Before learning of Split Lease, Brad had pursued other solutions. Brad described his frustrated search for a "repeat listing for a return trip to the same location and the ability to see multiple non-continuous availabilities."</p>

                    <h2>Brad Tried Lesser Alternatives:</h2>

                    <h3>1. Renting a Space Full-Time</h3>
                    <p>While this could work, Brad would be required to pay for nights he isn't using the space making it very costly.</p>

                    <h3>2. Booking a Hotel Room</h3>
                    <p>While a hotel would allow Brad to pay for only the nights he needs, the room feels nothing like a home (no kitchen, check-in/check-out, single room, etc). Plus, Brad would be forced into paying a premium on the nightly price that comes with hotels.</p>

                    <h3>3. Using Craigslist</h3>
                    <p>Brad resorted to Craigslist to try and piece together his own solution with someone who could accommodate. In his search, Brad had come across a Split Lease host that advertised on Craigslist as well.</p>

                    <h2>The Split Lease Solution</h2>
                    <p>Brad needed a space <strong>safe enough</strong> for him and <strong>his young daughter</strong> to return to. He knew the price he was willing to pay to achieve his goals and negotiated with many hosts, ultimately creating a positive relationship with <strong>Nneka</strong>.</p>

                            <p><strong>What Made Split Lease Unique</strong></p>
                            <p>Brad was happy to tell us how helpful we were. Our, "ability to show repeated visits to the same place over a long period of time with the regular frequency was unique and valuable and then my only extra need then was an ability to select a longer return frequency."</p>
