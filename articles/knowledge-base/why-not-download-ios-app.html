                    <h1>Why you shouldn't download our iOS app</h1>
                    <p class="text-muted">Yes, we want to tell you why you shouldn't download our iOS app... really!</p>
                </div>

                <div class="article-body">

                    <h2>#1 The website experience is sufficient for you</h2>
                    <p><em>You're a patient person</em>. Our website is <strong>great for browsing and viewing listings</strong>. In fact, it's hard to fit the map and listing details all onto that iPhone screen.</p>

                    <p><em>You're smart</em>. You balance the <strong>upfront time cost of downloading and setting up the app</strong> with the <strong>quick website load times</strong>. Who cares if the site takes a couple more seconds to load? Browsing rentals and seeing blog articles is easy to do without an account and without downloading the app.</p>

                    <h2>#2 You haven't reserved a stay yet</h2>
                    <p>After reserving, the iOS app is your hub for everything related to your booking. Get the <strong>access code</strong> to your Split Lease, <strong>pay for your booking, extend</strong> or <strong>change</strong> your booking dates, <strong>take screenshots</strong> and send information to friends, and have the <strong>wifi password ready to copy</strong> from the app to your wifi settings.</p>

                    <h2>#3 You don't need notifications</h2>
                    <p>You can be a great host without the fastest response time, but real time Split Lease notifications are only available within the app. For both hosts and guests, our app can provide real time notifications such as when a <strong>ghost roommate</strong> has <strong>entered</strong> the space, a new <strong>booking request</strong>, or whether someone has access to a private area with your belongings being held.</p>

                    <h2>#4 You don't need your iPhone's functionality</h2>
                    <p>iPhones are great, but they can't solve everything‚Ä¶ at least not yet. While your iPhone can't unlock the front door, it can allow you to request and <strong>receive the day's access code</strong> during your days in the space. Easily <strong>pay for your booking</strong> and <strong>request date changes</strong> with just a couple of taps.</p>

                    <p>First time arriving? Don't know where you are going? You can use your phone's GPS settings to see if you are close enough to your booked property.</p>

                    <h2>#5 You're not a host on our platform</h2>
                    <p>So, you're 1 of the over 7 billion people in this world that isn't a Split Lease host? Then receiving updates on <strong>your listing's performance</strong> compared to others in the area won't be helpful to you. Neither would <strong>seeing private reviews</strong> of your space and learning how to improve the next stay while earning points.</p>

                    <p>But if you were to list‚Ä¶ our platform allows for an instant transition from the first guest notification, to hosting your next booking. Catering to repeating users ensures a <strong>steady stream of income</strong> and is <strong>less work</strong> than short term rentals. Now making money has never been easier.</p>

                    <h2>#6 You don't need to track your belongings or talk to your ghost roommate</h2>
                    <p>While you may be one of the few who can remember what they had for dinner 2 nights ago, not everyone has this superpower. Always know what stuff is at your second home right in the Split Lease app. With the app's built in messaging features, you can stay in <strong>contact with your ghost roommate</strong>. Easily chat about who is leaving what in the space and <strong>complete favors for points</strong>!</p>

                    <h2>#7 You hate money</h2>
                    <p><strong>You don't have to pay full price for cleaning fees</strong>. We reward guests that take care of their space and leave it ready for their ghost roommates. Quickly snap some photos and never pay those crazy high cleaning fees again.</p>

                            <p><strong>Daily Rewards</strong></p>
                            <p>Don't miss out on <strong>daily rewards</strong> from using the app. When you log in to the app, you earn points which can be redeemed for cash. Each point is worth 4 cents. Everyday, users can get anywhere between 1-1000 points just for logging in. Once a day, one user will get the confetti surprise, which is a jackpot worth 1000 points. That's a value of $40!</p>

                    <h2>Still Think You Don't Need It?</h2>
                    <p>Okay, we tried to warn you! But if you've made it this far, you probably realize that the app actually offers a lot of value‚Äîespecially if you're an active Split Lease user. Download it from the App Store when you're ready to unlock all these features!</p>
