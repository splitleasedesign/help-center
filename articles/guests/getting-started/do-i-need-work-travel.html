                            <p><strong>Real Example</strong></p>
                            <p>One of our guests uses Split Lease every weekend to visit their elderly mother in Brooklyn. Another guest maintains a place in Manhattan for date nights and cultural events, despite living in New Jersey during the week.</p>

                    <h2>What Matters Most</h2>

                    <p>The key factor isn't <em>why</em> you need a second home - it's that you need one <strong>regularly and predictably</strong>.</p>

                    <p><strong>You're a great fit for Split Lease if you:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Visit the same city on a recurring schedule</li>
                        <li>Know roughly which days you'll be there (even if flexible)</li>
                        <li>Want consistency and your own space (not hotels)</li>
                        <li>Use the space respectfully as a secondary home</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Work travel isn't required - just regular travel of any kind!</strong></p>

                    <h2>Popular Use Cases (Non-Work)</h2>

                    <p><strong>The Weekend Commuter</strong><br>
                    Lives in NYC Monday-Friday for work, goes home to family upstate on weekends. Split Lease provides their weekday place.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Family Caregiver</strong><br>
                    Visits aging parents in Boston every other weekend. Split Lease gives them a comfortable, familiar place to stay.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Culture Enthusiast</strong><br>
                    Maintains a subscription to NYC Broadway shows and visits twice a month. Split Lease is their Manhattan base.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Co-Parent</strong><br>
                    Shares custody requiring presence in another city alternate weeks. Split Lease provides stability for those weeks.</p>

                    <h2>When Work Travel Isn't Involved</h2>

                    <p>Some considerations if you're not traveling for work:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Budget:</strong> Make sure the rental fits your personal budget (since there's no employer reimbursement)</li>
                        <li><strong>Schedule clarity:</strong> Being clear about your recurring pattern helps hosts plan</li>
                        <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Share your use case with hosts - many love supporting family visits or personal pursuits</li>
                    </ul>
