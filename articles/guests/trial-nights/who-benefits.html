                    <h2>Who Might Skip Trial Nights?</h2>

                    <p>Trial nights aren't mandatory, but skipping them is rarer. You might book directly if:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The host has 50+ glowing reviews</li>
                        <li>You've had extensive communication with the host</li>
                        <li>You've seen a video tour and feel completely confident</li>
                        <li>Time pressure requires you to start immediately</li>
                        <li>The listing perfectly matches a place you've stayed before</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Even then, we still recommend trials when possible!</strong></p>

                    <h2>What Makes Trial Nights So Valuable?</h2>

                    <p><strong>In-Person Beats Everything</strong><br>
                    No amount of photos, reviews, or messages can fully replace experiencing the space yourself.</p>

                    <p><strong>Meet Your Future Host</strong><br>
                    You'll be interacting with this person regularly. Meeting face-to-face builds trust and rapport.</p>

                    <p><strong>Discover Deal-Breakers</strong><br>
                    That "minor" noise from the street? The "barely noticeable" smell? Better to find out now.</p>

                    <p><strong>Find Hidden Gems</strong><br>
                    Sometimes you discover amazing features that weren't obvious in photos - great rooftop access, perfect morning light, friendly neighbors.</p>

                    <p><strong>Build Confidence</strong><br>
                    Starting a long-term arrangement with a trial night gives you peace of mind and conviction in your choice.</p>
