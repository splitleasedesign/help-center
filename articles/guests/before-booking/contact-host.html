                            <p>Since you'll potentially be staying with them regularly for months or years, it's smart to ask questions, clarify details, and make sure you're compatible before committing.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Click "I'm Interested" on any listing</li>

                    <h2>Tips for Effective Host Communication</h2>

                    <p><strong>Be Professional but Friendly</strong><br>
                    You're starting a potential long-term relationship. Be courteous, clear, and personable.</p>

                    <p><strong>Introduce Yourself</strong><br>
                    Briefly explain who you are, why you need the space, and your schedule. This helps hosts understand your needs.</p>

                    <p><strong>Be Specific</strong><br>
                    "Can I work from the space?" is vague. "Is there a desk with good lighting and a comfortable chair?" is better.</p>

                    <p><strong>Show Flexibility</strong><br>
                    If something doesn't quite match your ideal, ask if adjustments are possible rather than immediately moving on.</p>

                    <p><strong>Ask About Timing</strong><br>
                    If you need to start soon, mention your timeline so the host knows it's an active inquiry.</p>

                    <div class="info-box success">
                        <div class="info-box-icon"><i data-feather="star"></i></div>
                        <div class="info-box-content">
                            <p><strong>Good Guests Get Priority</strong></p>
                            <p>Hosts pay attention to how you communicate. Thoughtful, respectful inquiries often lead to hosts being extra accommodating. You're auditioning for each other!</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <h2>What Hosts Want to Know About You</h2>

                    <p>Great messages often proactively answer:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Your situation:</strong> Why you need the space</li>
                        <li><strong>Your schedule:</strong> Which days, how often</li>
                        <li><strong>Your timeline:</strong> When you want to start</li>
                        <li><strong>Your expectations:</strong> What's important to you in a space</li>
                        <li><strong>Your flexibility:</strong> How rigid or flexible your needs are</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Red Flags to Watch For</h2>

                    <p>If a host:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Never responds to multiple messages</li>
                        <li>Gives evasive answers to direct questions</li>
                        <li>Pressures you to book without answering questions</li>
                        <li>Asks you to communicate off-platform before booking</li>
                        <li>Shows irritation at reasonable questions</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>...these may be signs to look for a different listing. Great hosts welcome questions!</p>

                    <h2>After Your Initial Contact</h2>

                    <p>Once you've messaged a host:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Check your notifications:</strong> You'll be alerted when they respond</li>
                        <li><strong>Continue the conversation:</strong> Ask follow-up questions as needed</li>
                        <li><strong>Arrange a viewing/trial:</strong> Many hosts offer virtual tours or trial nights</li>
                        <li><strong>Move forward when ready:</strong> Once questions are answered, submit a booking request</li>
                    </ol>

                    <div class="info-box info">
                        <div class="info-box-icon"><i data-feather="message-circle"></i></div>
